## Cadastral Survey

This is the container for exchange of data using the Cadastral Survey Data Model.

It is modelled as a GeoJSON Feature Collection, consequently all the surveyed features can be:

- referenced internally using an obvious pattern (and generic tool support)
- visualised by a GeoJSON aware client.

Addition properties carry nested CSDs containing adopted features, provenance, annotations and the set of observations performed in a survey.
