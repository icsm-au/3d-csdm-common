- title: Example Survey Points
  content: |-
    An example Survey Point showing use of GeoJSON geometry and compound names.
    Note that the in FG-JSON "place" is used as a geometry element since "geometry" is defined to be WGS84,
     however by "prior agreement" an alternative CRS can be defined.

    Either geometry will inherit its CRS from the container's defaults.
    3D wil require an extended model however - possibly by extending FG-JSON - or adding explicit topology.
