This document outlines an overarching "road map" for the further testing and refinement of the CSDM Data Exchange Specification.

Each topic is detailed in a separate sub-document - providing a "modular" approach that can be cherry-picked for consideration by specific audiences.

This index includes elements describing the profiling process, which is documented in the [3d-csdm-profiles repository](https://github.com/icsm-au/3d-csdm-profiles)
Topics:

* [Alignments](future_alignments.md) - considerations regarding emerging and potential standards that may assist uptake processes.
* [3D RoadMap](3D_road_map.md) - roadmap for 3D implementation and testing
* [Vocabulary Management](https://github.com/icsm-au/3d-csdm-profiles/blob/main/VOCABULARY_MANAGEMENT.md) - management of vocabularies for profile development and refinement
* [Testing](testing.md) - roadmap for further recommended testing
* [Version management](versioning.md) - Notes regarding version management.
